Website proposed by the COMP 1223 - Web Development - course at George Brown College.

This website shows my present skills, knowledge and understading of HTML5 and CSS to create my personal portfolio. In this website, I've used one external CSS stylesheet applying to multiple pages to unify the design and presentantion. I've used semantic elements to make it more acessible, a navigation menu in all pages, lists, tables, images and an embed map.
